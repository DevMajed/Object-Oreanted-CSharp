# Quadratic Equation Solver
  This is a code that solves equations in the form AX^2 + BX + C. where A,B, and C are real double precision numbers.

  the end result will be a program that accepts three doubles, and prints the roots of the quadratic equation.
  possible outputs will be in the form:
  ```
  The equation AX^2 + BX + C has two real roots: Y, Z
  The equation AX^2 + BX + C has one real root: Z
  The equation AX^2 + BX + C has two imaginary roots: L+Mi, L-Mi
  ```
  
  This was a lab, and it was part of a course in object oreanted programing with C# .
  The objective was to create the code using classes and to pass all the tests in order to make a paerfect quadratic calculator
